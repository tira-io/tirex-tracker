The TIREx tracker is a command line tool and API to automatically track resource usage, hardware specifications, and other metadata when running information retrieval experiments.
It can be used easily in [Java/Kotlin applications](#javakotlinjvm-api). For more information, refer to the [project's readme](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

## Java/Kotlin/JVM API

The Java/Kotlin API can be installed via Gradle or Maven from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker/packages/).
To use GitHub Packages, you must first authenticate ([Maven instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages), [Gradle instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)).
After installing the package, you can use the TIREx tracker JVM API in your [Java](#java-usage) or [Kotlin](#kotlin-usage) projects.

### Gradle Dependency

For Gradle, add the following line to the `dependencies` block of your `build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`) file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("io.tira:tirex-tracker:x.x.x")
}
```

### Maven Dependency

For Maven projects, add these lines to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.tira</groupId>
  <artifactId>tirex-tracker</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace the version placeholder (`x.x.x`) with the [latest version tag](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker/releases/latest).


You can now use the TIREx tracker JVM API in your [Java](#java-usage) or [Kotlin](#kotlin-usage) projects.

### Java Usage

For pure Java projects, the easiest way is to use the `track` function and pass your code to be tracked as a lambda like this:

```java
package io.tira.tirex.tracker.example;

import io.tira.tirex.tracker.*;

void main() {
    var result = Tracker.track(() -> {
        // Do something...
    });

    System.out.println(result);
}
```

Alternatively, use the [try-with-resources syntax](https://baeldung.com/java-try-with-resources) like this:

```java
Tracked tracked = new Tracked();
try (tracked) {
    // Do something...
}
    
System.out.println(tracked.result);
```

<!-- TODO: Explain parameters. -->

### Kotlin Usage

In Kotlin projects, the `track` function takes an [inline block](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-functions.html) so that your code can be tracked like this:

```kotlin
package io.tira.tirex.tracker.example

import io.tira.tirex.tracker.*

fun main() {
  val result = track {
    // Do something...
  }

  println(result)
}
```

## Abstract

> The reproducibility and transparency of retrieval experiments heavily depends on properly provided information on the experimental setup and conditions. But as manually curating such experiment metadata can be tedious, error-prone, and inconsistent, metadata should be systematically collected in an automatic wayâ€”similar to the collection of Python and git-specific settings in the `ir_metadata` reference implementation. To enable a platform-independent automatic metadata collection following the `ir_metadata` specification, we introduce the TIREx tracker: a tool realized via a lightweight C binary, pre-compiled with all dependencies for all major platforms to track hardware configurations, usage of power/CPUs/RAM/GPUs, and experiment/system versions. The TIREx tracker seamlessly integrates into Python, Java, or C/C++ workflows and can be easily incorporated in run submissions of shared tasks, which we showcase for the TIRA/TIREx platform. Code, binaries, and documentation are publicly available at <https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker>.
