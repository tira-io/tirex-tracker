The TIREx tracker is a command line tool and API to automatically track resource usage, hardware specifications, and other metadata when running information retrieval experiments.
It can be used easily in [Python applications](#python-api). For more information, refer to the [project's readme](https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).

## Python API

First, install the TIREx tracker Python package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tirex-tracker/):

```shell
pip install tirex-tracker
```

Now, you can track the hardware metrics and metadata of your Python code by using the [context manager](https://geeksforgeeks.org/context-manager-in-python/):

```python
from tirex_tracker import tracking

with tracking() as results:
    # Do something...

print(results)
```

Alternatively, you can track the hardware metrics and metadata of a Python function by using the [function decorator](https://geeksforgeeks.org/decorators-in-python/):

```python
from tirex_tracker import tracked

@tracked
def do_something():
    # Do something...

do_something()

print(do_something.results)
```

If you cannot use either the context manager or the function decorator from above, you can manually start and stop the tracking:

```python
from tirex_tracker import start_tracking, stop_tracking

handle = start_tracking()
try:
    # Do something...
finally:
    results = stop_tracking(handle)

print(results)
```

## Abstract

> The reproducibility and transparency of retrieval experiments heavily depends on properly provided information on the experimental setup and conditions. But as manually curating such experiment metadata can be tedious, error-prone, and inconsistent, metadata should be systematically collected in an automatic wayâ€”similar to the collection of Python and git-specific settings in the `ir_metadata` reference implementation. To enable a platform-independent automatic metadata collection following the `ir_metadata` specification, we introduce the TIREx tracker: a tool realized via a lightweight C binary, pre-compiled with all dependencies for all major platforms to track hardware configurations, usage of power/CPUs/RAM/GPUs, and experiment/system versions. The TIREx tracker seamlessly integrates into Python, Java, or C/C++ workflows and can be easily incorporated in run submissions of shared tasks, which we showcase for the TIRA/TIREx platform. Code, binaries, and documentation are publicly available at <https://github.com/tira-io/tirex-tracker>.
